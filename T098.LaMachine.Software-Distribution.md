# Task: LaMachine - Software Distribution

**ID**: T098


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** The [LaMachine distribution](https://proycon.github.io/LaMachine  ) exists and provides a Docker container, a Virtual Machine or a locally user-space compiled environment. It is the main way in which we (RUN) make available our entire software stack (Frog, ucto, PICCL, gecco, FoLiA, CLAM, etc..) in a flexible manner to the outside world, regardless of whether that outside world consists of individual developers/researchers or full-fledged CLARIN centres.

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

LaMachine is something that needs to be constantly maintained as it lives in an ever-moving ecosystem of software. The
main focus is on supporting actual users (again these can be CLARIN centres or individual institutions/users), e.g.
people come to us with questions.  We add new software where necessary and ensure LaMachine is up to date with the
latest versions and runs on a wide variety of platforms.

We are very much open to inclusion of tools by other CLARIAH partners in LaMachine (provided they comply with certain
software quality & sustainability guidelines). Integrating VUâ€™s SeMachine idea is an option (rather than providing it as
a separate project)


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** Ensures CLARIAH software is practically installable on local user machines (which can be preferable in many cases) and not just available as a service and ensured CLARIN hosting centres can run our software.

**Targeted/Actual users:** developers, researchers, students, CLARIN centres, other hosters


**Actual use (quantify!):** Current use of LaMachine can be tracked in our statistical report: http://applejack.science.ru.nl/lamastats/lamachinestats.html

**Social Impact (concrete examples):** Out-of-the box usage of a lot of CLARIAH-funded software, ability to bring tools
to data centres, CLARIN centres. etc..

**Lead**: Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 6+PM, spread over the entire duration of CLARIAH-PLUS

**Proposed Participants + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel (6PM),  1PM INT (mostly client-side as a CLARIN centre)  + possibly 2PM VU participant if SeMachine integration is desired?   Same for others as RuG?

**Allocated PMs:** 3PM  **(This is not enough for proper support and maintenance!!)**

## Deliverables
