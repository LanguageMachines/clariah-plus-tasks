# Use cases for the Virtual Research Environment

## Introduction

In this document we collect actual specific use cases for the proposed Virtual Research
Environment. Which researchers require what specific functionality to conduct
their research?

Generic use-cases are already part of the [VRE plan](plan.md) and described as *user stories*.

## Template

* For the researcher to fill:
    * **Researcher names & affiliations:**
    * **Research question/project:** (short description)
    * **What functionality is desired and currently missing?**
* For us to fill:
    * **Is this in the scope of the VRE project?**
    * **What needs to be implemented?**
    * **How can we evaluate this?**
    * **Issue/ticket Link:**
