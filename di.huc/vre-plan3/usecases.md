# Use cases for the Virtual Research Environment

## Introduction

In this document we collect actual specific use cases for the proposed Virtual Research
Environment. Which researchers require what specific functionality to conduct
their research?

Generic use-cases are already part of the [VRE plan](plan.md) and described as *user stories*.

## Template

* For the researcher to fill:
    * **Researcher names & affiliations:**
    * **Research question/project:** (short description)
    * **What functionality is desired and currently missing?**
* For us to fill:
    * **Is this in the scope of the VRE project?**
    * **What needs to be implemented?**
    * **How can we evaluate this?**
    * **Issue/ticket Link:**


## Open Use Cases

These are use cases that are still open:

## Rejected Use Cases

These are use cases that are have been rejected because they are either to big for the VRE scope, or too small and
should be dealt with by upstream projects instead.

## Satisfied Use Cases

These are use cases that are already satisfied:
