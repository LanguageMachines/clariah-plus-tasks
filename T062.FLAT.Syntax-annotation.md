# Task: Extend FLAT with extended support for more convenient editing of syntactic annotation and dependency annotation

**ID:** T062

**Author:** Maarten van Gompel

**What exists:**
In CLARIAH, the FoLiA Linguistic Annotation Tool (FLAT) has obtained support for visualizing, as well as initial editing, of syntactic information (constituency parses, dependency relations), mainly as part of the following issues:
* [flat#85: Implement Syntax Tree Visualisation](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/85)
* [flat#3: Edit more complex forms of span annotation: dependencies, co-references](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/3)

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**
* [flat#111](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/111) - The current interface for syntax editing and dependency editing may not be the most convenient for end users yet. We should investigate whether more visual interfaces (interacting more directly with the actual tree visualisation) can be constructed, and implement them.

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** This would make available a FoLiA-based treebank editor

**Targeted/Actual users:** Researchers

**Actual use (quantify!):** Projects such as AnnCor demand this functionality. Whether this task should be implemented depends on the interest of such and future similar projects in adopting FLAT for annotating needs. Feedback from the initial exploration of the possibility of using FLAT by UU for AnnCor is required as well as that would largely determine the details of implementation.

**Social Impact (concrete examples):** Happy annotators?

**Lead + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 6PM (possibly more if other partners contribute, joint effort with RuG would be nice?)

**Proposed Participants + PMs: Maarten van Gompel; 6PM**  [b] + RuG (+ UU?) if task T061 is subsumed under this one (which Iâ€™d recommend)

**Allocated PMs:** 6PM? unclear, awaiting feedback from CLARIAH management
