# Task: Manual adaptation/annotation of alignment in parallel corpora (in FLAT)


**IDs**: T063


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** FLAT exists, FoLiA has facilities for expressing alignments between structural elements or annotation across documents


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**
* [flat#84](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/84): Facilities for FoLiA’s alignments have to be implemented in FLAT as it’s currently not supported yet  (1PM)
* [flat#113](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/113): A dual-document view needs to be implemented in FLAT, currently it only has a single-document view  (3PM)


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** This further increases the features of the annotation tool and opens it up to new types of research


**Targeted/Actual users:** Researchers/annotators


**Actual use (quantify!):** Some questions recently arose on Corpora-List (Irina Temnikova: Looking for a tool to manually correct & edit two aligned files) and no present tools really accommodate this yet. That could be answered by this functionality.


**Social Impact (concrete examples):**


**Lead**: Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify)**: 4PM (justified in description above)

**Proposed Participants + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel (4PM)

**Allocated PMs:** 0PM? unclear, awaiting feedback from CLARIAH management whether this was aggregated into a more generic FLAT task
