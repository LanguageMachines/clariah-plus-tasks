# Task: CLAM Maintenance & Support

**ID**: T142


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** CLAM has been around since 2011 and is in active use


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:** This task merely reserves maintenance and support for users/service provicers, ensures bugs are fixed and requested features are implemented; provides the necessary continuity.


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** CLAM is used by many NLP webservices in and beyond of CLARIN/CLARIAH


**Targeted/Actual users:** Developers, service providers


**Actual use (quantify!):** Usage of the CLAM webservices hosted in Nijmegen can be tracked in our [statistical report](http://applejack.science.ru.nl/lamastats/clamstats.html), does not include stats on any CLAM services hosted by other parties (and there are various)


**Social Impact (concrete examples):** -

**Lead**: Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 2PM, spread over the entire duration of CLARIAH-PLUS. Considering the current maturity of CLAM we donâ€™t expect this to take too much time.

**Proposed Participants + PMs** Maarten van Gompel, 2PM

**Allocated PMs**: 3PM
