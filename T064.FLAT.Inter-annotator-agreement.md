# Topic: Incorporate facilities for computation of inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation in FLAT or an extension thereof


**ID**: T064


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** FLAT exists as a mature annotation environment, but without interfaces to any kind of evaluation


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**
* [flat#112](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/112) - User-friendly tools for researchers to compute inter-annotator agreement of arbitrary FoLiA annotations.


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

Computation of IAA is an important evaluation metric and evaluation tools are currently not provided by FLAT at all; having such a facility as an interface for end-users in FLAT makes evaluation more accessible and prevents researchers having to write their own evaluation scripts. The demand for such an interface has arisen in a few projects already.

**Targeted/Actual users:** Researchers

**Actual use (quantify!):** Requests for this also arose from the PARSEME project, as well as other FLAT users.

**Social Impact (concrete examples):** -

**Lead + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 2PM

**Proposed participants + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel (2PM)

**Allocated PMs:** 0PM? unclear, awaiting feedback from CLARIAH management whether this was aggregated into a more generic FLAT task

## Deliverables

* Software: [FLAT](https://github.com/proycon/flat)
    * Resolution of [flat#112](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/112)
