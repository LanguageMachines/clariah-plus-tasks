## Task: FLAT sustainability & major refactoring to use modern front-end javascript frameworks

**ID**: xx1 *(No official ID, new since initial proposal, but important)*


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** In CLARIAH, the FoLiA Linguistic Annotation Tool (FLAT) has been developed since 2014

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**


Currently the front-end technologies used in FLAT are fairly old and basic (jquery+js+css), and not leveraging the power of modern frontend javascript frameworks (angular, reactjs, vuejs). For sake of maintainability and extensibility towards the future, a refactoring project to such a modern front-end is desirable.  See [Issue 135](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/135)


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** This is vital for the sustainability of FLAT and continued improvement, all other FLAT proposals would rely on this being accomplished first.


**Targeted/Actual users:** In the end, researchers


**Actual use (quantify!):** FLAT is used by various project.


**Social Impact (concrete examples):** Long term sustainability; improved extensibility


**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 4PM

**Lead + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel

**Participants + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel; 4PM

**Assigned PMs:** 0PM? Awaiting feedback from CLARIAH management
