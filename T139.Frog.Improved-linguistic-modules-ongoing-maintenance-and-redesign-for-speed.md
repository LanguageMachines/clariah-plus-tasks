# Task: Improved linguistic modules for Frog, ongoing maintenance and redesign for speed

**ID**: T139


**Author:** Iris Hendrickx, Antal van den Bosch, Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** Frog is an integration of memory-based natural language
processing (NLP) modules developed for Dutch. Frog performs tokenization,
part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and morphological segmentation of word
tokens. At the sentence level Frog identifies non-embedded phrase chunks in the
sentence, recognizes named entities and assigns a dependency parse graph.


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:** Some components of the
toolkit are already 25 years old; the more recent components are nearly one
decade old. Some of the modules need to be updated to state of the art
techniques and all sub modules can be upgraded by training them on newly
available data sets. The POS-tagger could be retrained using modern algorithms.
The dependency parser in Frog is intended to be a lean and fast alternative to
the more precise but slow Alpino parser - it was already reimplemented
completely and made faster in CLARIAH WP3 and can now be trained on
significantly more training data (training software for Frog was explicitly
developed in the scope of CLARIAH), achieving scores closer to that of Alpino
(Canisius and Van den Bosch, 2007). In addition, this task provides for the
continued maintenance of Frog, as a popular software package for which users
often come to us with questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

Furthermore, we plan a fundamental re-design of Frog to:
* reduce complexity
* increase maintainability
* be more flexible
* speed things up
The main aspect to consider: At the moment Frog uses FoLiA as it's internal data-structure. That seemed a good plan once, but with growing data-sets this now became a memory hog. Also it has some nasty MultiThreading issue sand makes processing line-by-line almost impossible, as the whole input file is stuffed into one FoLiA document.
Redesigning the internal process to handle smaller chunks would speed up the process, and will deliver output at a more constant pace.

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** Updating and maintaining a toolkit that is already part of Clariah and a toolkit that is used often.

**Targeted/Actual users:** End-users/developers/researchers


**Actual use (quantify!):**

The paper describing the core tool and algorithms from 2007 (Van den Bosch et
al, 2007) has been cited 127 times in other works. Frog is widely used in the
Dutch NLP community. Exact figures are hard to track but an indication is given
by visits to its website and github page (see [our report](http://applejack.science.ru.nl/lamastats/lamastats.html#frog) ).


**Social Impact (concrete examples):**

Satisfied users due to better quality of linguistic enrichment; improved text
analytics further down the pipeline (e.g. when Frog is used for preprocessing
in other information systems), handling huge data files

**Lead:** Ko van der Sloot

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 12 PM =  retraining pos-tagger (2PM) + reimplementations and maintenance (3PM) + retraining and upgrading dependency tagger (3PM) + redesign(4PM)

**Proposed Participants + PMs:** Ko van der Sloot, Iris Hendrickx, Maarten van Gompel

**Allocated PMs:** 6PM
