# Task: New CLARIN Centre CLST Nijmegen

**ID**: T018

**Author:** Maarten van Gompel

**What exists:** Nijmegen hosts the successful [CLST Webservice Portal](https://webservices-lst.science.ru.nl) hosting a
variety of CLAM-based webservices for various NLP tools (Frog, ucto, PICCL, T-scan, Colibri Core, Valkuil, etc..). These
services are currently protected by a simple authentication layer with a stand-alone user database. People can register
for a free account.


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:** Further integration in the CLARIAH infrastructure would be welcome
by moving to the federated single-sign on framework. First of all, however, the feasibility of this has to be studied:
CLAM has already been extended with OAuth2 support on request of CLARIN years ago, but nobody still uses this and weâ€™re
not sure if the necessary OAuth2 infrastructure is already in place. Second, proper metadata for the webservices has to
be created and published (where?). Webapplications such as OpenSoNaR+ are not hooked up to SSO either yet and should be
included in this effort.


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** Improves accessibility by enabling researchers to access various services using their institutional credentials. This would contribute to turning Nijmegen into a CLARIN centre.

**Targeted/Actual users:** Researchers

**Actual use (quantify!):** Current actual use of the webservices is quantified exactly in our [statistical report](https://applejack.science.ru.nl/lamastats/clamstats.html).

**Social Impact (concrete examples):** better accessibility/findability

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 8PM  (1PM feasibility study + 6PM implementation + 1PM metadata), If deemed unfeasible/unimplementable after study however, all remaining PMs can be scrapped

**Lead + PMs:** Henk van den Heuvel

**Participants + proposed PMs:** Maarten van Gompel: 5PM , Wessel Stoop: 1PM,  C&CZ system administrator: 1PM; Erwin Komen for metadata  1PM

**Assigned PMs:** 5PM (-3)

## Deliverables

1. Access to CLAM-based webservices at CLST via federated single-sign on
2. Access to FLAT at CLST via federated single-sign on
3. Access to OpenSonar+ at CLST via federated single-sign on
