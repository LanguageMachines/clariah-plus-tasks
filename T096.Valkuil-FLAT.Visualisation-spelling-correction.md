# Task: Web-based interface for the visualisation of spelling correction

**ID**: T096


**Author:** Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:** We currently have FLAT and [Valkuil](http://valkuil.net)
(powered by Gecco) as well as Fowlt for English. FLAT has superior abilities to
display spelling correction compared to the old Valkuil interface.


**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:** The old Valkuil frontend is
superseded by FLAT, which has better visualisation capabilities. We need to
tweak the FLAT interface for user friendly visualisation of suggestions for
spelling correction and to apply the desired corrections and connect the
valkuil backend to FLAT. The old Valkuil interface can then be deprecated.


**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):** Mature visualisation of
spelling correction, less duplication of effort. Deeper integration between
spelling correction and linguistic annotation, more options to “do something”
with the results.


**Targeted/Actual users:** End-users, researchers


**Actual use (quantify!):** Use of Valkuil and Fowlt is in our [report](https://applejack.science.ru.nl/lamastats/clamstats.html)


**Social Impact (concrete examples):** A good mature end-to-end demo case for spelling correction


**Lead + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel

**Proposed PM estimatation (try to justify):** 3PM

**Proposed participants + PMs:** Maarten van Gompel, 3PM

**Allocated PMs:** proably 0PM unclear, but awaiting feedback from CLARIAH management in case this was aggregated under a more generic FLAT task

## Deliverables

* Software: [FLAT](https://github.com/proycon/flat)
* Software: [Valkuil](https://github.com/proycon/valkuil) (will be dramatically simplified), hosted [at CLST on valkuil.net](https://valkuil.net)
